      <p>1. Understand how store associates in different roles spend their shift on the salesfloor.

      2. Identify friction points within process to improve technology for associates and drive in-store conversion.
      <br />
      3. Undersatnd the interrelationship between people, process, payroll, equipment and technology.

            Based on a plan research team has drafted out, we are divided into 4 groups, each group has three
            members from ux research, design and store operation engineer. And each team was dedicated to one
            territory to observe 3 selected stores. We were observing 3 shifts of associates from around 9am
            till 9pm. In order to get a good idea of different tasks & different roles, we shadowed different
            roles in multiple departments. Each of us noted down our insights, notes and questions during the
            shadow session in a special form we designed earlier (see below). At the end of each shift, we will
            conduct a brief interview to further understand associates’ day to day work.

            It was a large amount of data to clean up. As soon as we all got back to the office, we start
            the conversation about how to clean, organize and further analyze the data we have. There are
            notes of 420 store hours work, 35 interview records, time stamps on different tasks and location
            stamps for each store per shift, plus all the pictures we captured during the shadowing session.
            With affinity diagram, I helped designed this poster to put together most of notes we have. The
            process was highly collaborative, members from 2 design studios and 3 teams are gathered around
            to go through all data recorded per store one by one. It took us about a month to finish the
            data analysis process.</p>

          <p>Now we have most of the data cleaned up based on different criterias.
            The design team start to explore different ways to present the data to our stakeholders.
            There were a lot back and forth with the research team to make sure the data is easy to
            understand but at the same time, accurate. In the end, We delivered three main pieces in
            order to capture associates' experience in different scales:
            <br />
            An associate journey map to understand their daily tasks in a heuristic view;
            <br />
            An interactive map to zoom into one store, one associate to present a typical shift;
            <br />
            Two visual borads to further digest those painpoints for store associates. </p>

            <br />We documented all the associates we had shadowed with into the journey map. These cards provide a good
            idea of what we have considered - roles, departments, timelines, store sizes and locations. All above have

            This map documents and visualizes one associate’s walking path for one shift. Each point reprents one task. Color is used
            here to indicate whether or not this associate feels frustrated. More details (task, emotions &amp; highlights) can be
            viewed by clicking into each point.

          <h2>Step 4: Stakeholder Shareouts &amp; Iterations</h2>
          <p>Presenting this journey map was a great learning experience for me.
            Since there are so many aspects and stories in the map, I have prepared
            different versions of stories based on the audience. For store operations
            team, I will empathsize mostly on the data patterns we found through
            quantitative research, and also the insights &amp; recommendations
            from design team since they are very familiar with associates’ daily struggles.
            For product &amp; business teams, I will elaborate more on the associates stories
            and frustrations to raise awareness on how could current technology better support their job.
            After each presentation, we will reflect on the questions we got and make
            updates to the journey map. There were <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">8 versions of updates we made

            <br />
            I feel really fortunate to be part of a foundamental project like this.
            I also really really appreciate that Kohl’s are willing to take the time
            and resources to <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">take a step back,
            think in a bigger picture and then move forward.</span>

            <br />This project was wrapped up in early 2017, but till today, we still get requests
            from our partners to going back to those data, stories and insights we learned from it.
            It is a great PR project to showcase what is user-centered thinking and doing.
            As a matter of fact, our research team continued to work on sub-topic projects based on
            insights from this associate journey map. For the design team, this is helping us to
            priorities the work we have in the future and let the incoming designers to better
            empathized with our associates work in the store.
            <br />
            It is difficult to provide an exact KPI or measurement on how much of an impact this
            project has for Kohl’s. However, as part of the team, one thing that I know is that
            everyone who works on this feel very proud of what we do. </p>
