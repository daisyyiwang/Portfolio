        <p><span id="h">T</span>oday, Kohl's offers a Yes2You(Y2Y) rewards program
        for non-Kohl's charge (credit card) holders to enjoy points off. It is a rewards
        system introduced about 3 years ago. This rewards program significantly helped
        Kohl's to win 2 types of customers:
        <br/>
        1.People who love to shop &amp; save at Kohl's but don't want to have another credit card.
        <br/>
        2.Potential Kohl's charge holders who just start to shop with Kohl's.
        <br/>
         While the program kept a lot of new Kohl's shoppers, its complicated calculation system is
         keeping away a large amount of potential shoppers.
         <br/>
         To simplify this points system, Kohl's loyalty team approached us with an exciting proposal:

      <p>I helped the initial design pitch to get his new rewards program successfully founded by

          <h2>To Gather All the Thoughts in the Beginning</h2>
          <p>It can be very challenging to collaborate with a wide range of partners on
          a big project like this. So our research team conducted a design workshop to
          help align the expectations in the beginning. Together with the Business Credit,
          Product, Store Operation, Creative and Marketing team, we analyzed the current
          rewards program and envisioned the key takeways our future rewards program should follow:
          <br />
          <br />
          KEY TAKEWAYS
          <br />
          -<span class="bold">Transparent</span>: Effortless understanding &amp; usage of rewards program.
          <br />
          -<span class="bold">Informative</span>: Consolidate the current earning methods to create a single
          window into earnings and savings.
          <br />
          -<span class="bold">Celebrative</span>: Leverage our data for personlized offers and to celebrate past,
          present and future earnings.

          <p>How to introduce the new rewards program? How to seamlessly provide the updated rewards info into the current flow? And how would this project impact the
          other ongoing projects? Based on the insights and takeaways from the design workshop, I created multiple design concepts to provide an initial look and feel
          for the core mobile experience.</p>

        <br />
        <p>To heuristically understand customer's needs, I leveraged this customer journey map. There are three different tags, which represent the three major parts in the
        new rewards program: track, earn and redeem. This helped the cross functional parnters and the business stakeholder to easily identify the key touch points in the
        new rewards experience early on.

          <p>The design pitch went very successful. It is so successful that more people are curious about the next steps. To better align and reflect business expectations on
          each screen across 5 different channels, I quickly put together this information architecture map in axure and reviewed it with the product and the rest of the design
          team to further analyze when, where and how should we integrate this new rewards program.</p>

          <p>One key insights we had from the design workshop was about introducing the celebrative
          elements to the experience. So one design for order confirmation page was to first show this celebrative modal. When
          this concept first proposed, it was well reveived internally. However, when we tested it out in the lab, our customers
          reacted a little more confused than feeling celebrative. <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">This finding leads to a better alignment within the team and
          I later replace this modal with a brief in-page animation design.</span> This was one of the many stories about how we
          iteratively refined the design concepts based on customers' feedback.</p>

              meetings. After rounds of presentations and design pitches, I summarized my takeaways:
              <br />
              Hi-fi wires is more suitable for design concept pitching to business stakeholders, if there is a brainding team, work
              with them to get a more accurate look and feel. Hi-fi wires are also very necessary for usability testing to get more
              accurate feedbacks. When presented to product or engineer team, low-fi wires with water marks are better suited to avoid
              confusing them with future deliverables.</p>

              <p>With so many designers involved in a long-term project, it is very easy to get lost. We used different tools, went to
              different meetings and took different notes. So document your design process with a consistent template, format in one
              place, work closely with your planner could be very helpful</p>

              to pitch ideas without visualize them in this scenario. Plus, I find it <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">very difficult to propose good concepts without really
              exploring "bad" ideas.</span> To make a strong design argument, oftern times, working on those "bad" ideas and go through them with your
              partnerscould make your design proposal more convincing.</p>
