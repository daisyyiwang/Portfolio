        <h2> Understand the terms, device &amp; current experience </h2>
        <p>Our lack of domain knowledge in inventory management meant we needed
          to understand the current process of inventory counting in the stores
          thoroughly and quickly. At the begining phase of the project, we
          conducted contextual inquiry with the store associates to understand
          the challenges and opportunities in their day-to-day work. These
          research methods also helped us to have a better view of the complexity
          side of inventory management
        <br />
        <br />Some challenges of the inventory counting we disovered:
        <br />üßëüë±üèÉIt takes at least 2 person and 4 trips to get an estimated
        count number
        <br />üôÄAccidently scan twice? You may have to rescan everthing.
        <br />üòµAssociates are memerizing "Yes or No" choices to avoid big mistakes.

        <p>One thing we agreed on from day one within the customer experience team
        is that this is a transitional experience. This is NOT to design something
        completely new from scratch. We should keep the experience from the RF
        device to the enterprise mobile phone, Bluebird as similar as possible to
        reduce unnecessary trainings for associates. This early design decision
        had a major impact on the quality of the end result throughout the design
        process.</p>

        <p>Within 2 weeks, with the support from my research partner, we were
        able to test out our design in 2 store locations, with 3 associates in
        different roles. We had 100% pass rate for the main flow and overall 80%
        success rate based on the key experience measurement. It was a really
        rewarding experience for me personally, especially when I heard from one
        associate love the experience so much that she ended the test by saying
        "I like it!" 3 times!üòâ</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Design Iteration: Save the Count First</h3>
        <p>When we put our proposed design in front of our associates, one thing
        we realised immediately was, we overlooked the environment/context they
        are in when they start to work on the counts. With so many boxes /
        merchandieses around, often times things will be misplaced. A sweater
        will end up in the shoe department, a missing jean will probably be
        "rescued" in the T-shirt piles. With the current design, when things
        like that happens, associate will have to ask store manager to reopen
        the count to make an update.</p>

        </div>
        <br />
        <p>To save the back and forth, I introduced this "Save" function in the
          final design so that when one count was completed, an associate doesn't
          have to submit the count to continue the next one. She/he can simply
          save the count until everything is scanned in and then submit all the
          counts together.

        <h2>Story to be Continued</h2>
        <h3>Design the User Experience</h3>
        <p>Part of the work here is to educate our partners about user experience
        instead of playing catching up game with feature release. We were initially
        given 2 weeks for this project in order to leave enough time for the
        development cycle. The conversation really open up when we start to present
        the stakeholders and the product partners what we have learned from current
        experience in the store after talking to associates, and how we are reflecting
        these insights in our design. Suprisingly, we realized how big a gap it was
        between our store associates and people work in the office. The photos &amp;
        insights we shared out helped us greatly to build the trust between the
        teams and to start a real conversation about timeline and features.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Design for Bluebird Windows 10</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest challenge for me was to design for bluebird, prior
        to that, I have never been exposed to the mobile windows 10 device since
        it is a retail tailored enterprise only device. And because of that,
        after we delivered this project, we had a lot back and forth conversations
        with the engineer team related to that, which requires me to read through
        the windows 10 dev documents in order to achieve a better experience result.
        <br />
        So after this project, I created a bluebird pattern library to help better
        support the other designers working on similar projects. And till today,
        our team had been working on over 10 bluebird apps for different projects&amp;
        features, and gradually, we can see how this design process &amp; pattern
        library are impacting more and more people working at Kohl's.</p>
