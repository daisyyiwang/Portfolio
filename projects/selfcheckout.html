        <p>Creating this in-store checkout experience was very rewarding and fruitful.
        As the lead experience designer, I worked very closely with customer research,
        product manager and project planning team. Together we collaboared with a cross-
        functional team of engineer, store operations, business, loss and prevention, etc
        to craft this experience from ideation to implementation.</p>

            <h2>Looking at the core experience</h2>
          <p>Communication was the most challenging part when we first start.
            There were at least 8 core teams involved, at 2 locations. Plus,
            <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">unlike other
            projects, to design a self-checkout system, we have to communicate
            with the store-related teams on top of product, research and engineer
            team.</span> To setup a good foundation, first thing I did was to align
            design expectations. I shared this 3 design principles across the
            core partners and talked through the main experience flow. This really
            helped to on-board everyone and set a healthy and open tune at the beginning.</p>

              <img src="../resources/images/sc-principle.svg" alt="design principle image" />
            </div>
          <p>A survey was then send out by our research team to understand customers'
            expectations and concerns. Together with a competitve analysis, we learned that
            two main concerns customers have are</p>
          <p>1. 72% of customers had difficult <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">
            finding an associate for help.</span></p>
          <p>2. 56% needed associate assistance due to difficulty with
            <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">applying coupons.</span></p>

          <h4>When &amp how to sign in as a rewards member?</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="image-container" id="principle">
          <img src="../resources/images/sc-proposal.svg" alt="design proposal image" />
        </div>
        <p>While checking out, theoratically, there are 3 ways for customers to
          sign in and identify themselves as a rewards member. So initially all
          the design concepts are about how to display these 3 sign-in methods on
          a side panel of the checkout screen. However, our lab test results shows that
          <br/>
          1. Most customers are <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">
            used to sign in with phone number.</span>
          <br/>
          2. They usually start checkout without looking at the screen first.
             Instead, <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">
             they will simply start scanning items.</span>
          <br/>
          This means that most customers will have a difficult time to apply their coupons,
          which based on our early survey, is people’s main concern when they
          learned that Kohl’s will be providing the self-checkout line.
          <br/>
          Based on the findings, I re-examined the flow and proposed something
          different this time:</p>
          <div class="image-container" id="principle">
            <img src="../resources/images/sc-flow.svg" alt="main flow image" />
          </div>
          <p>As shown above, the new design will provide the sign-in information
            after customer start to scan, and it will also remind the customers
            to apply their coupons once they finish scaning and ready to pay. We
            got quite positive feedbacks on this new flow, it makes sure that:
            <br/>
            1. Customers can <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">
              start checking out right away</span> without too much
            information upfront.
            <br/>
            2. The sign-in information is <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">
              always available</span> while checking out.
            <br/>
            3. We will remind customers <span class="ph" data-scroll-class="paragraph-highlight">
              proactively</span> about the coupons right before they are ready to pay.</p>
            <div class="image-container" id="principle">
              <img src="../resources/images/sc-signinfinal.svg" alt="final design image" />
            </div>
            <p>And once they signed in, we will clearly show available Kohl’s
              cash and coupons for customers on the right panel.</p>
            <div class="image-container" id="principle">
              <img src="../resources/images/sc-signinfinal02.svg" alt="final design image cont." />
            </div>
            <p>This is how we setup the lab using the same cashier checkout
              system and an eye-tracking device to learn how our customers
              interact with the design proposals.</p>
            <div class="image-container" id="principle">
              <img src="../resources/images/sc-testphoto.svg" alt="testing room image" />
            </div>

              <h4>How to clearly show and celebrate the earned rewards?</h4>
            </div>
            <p>Kohl’s is known for its Kohl’s cash. We have many customers come to
              shopping with Kohl's because they would like to spend or earn Kohl’s cash.
              When considering self-checkout, the complicated calculation of Kohl’s cash
              is people’s main complaint.
              To solve this problem, I worked with the marketing team closely to
              list out all the scenarios for Kohl’s cash and run through rounds
              of iterations to make sure the savings is easy, clear and delightful
              for customers.</p>
              <div class="image-container" id="principle">
                <img src="../resources/images/sc-senario.svg" alt="user senario image" />
              </div>
              <p>To help communicate with product, engineer and marketing team,
                and algin on how many different design scenarios we need, I created
                this user flow map. After I listed out all the scenarios, it becomes
                much clearer on how should we design this experience for users with
                different preference.</p>
              <div class="image-container" id="principle">
                <img src="../resources/images/sc-earnkc.svg" alt="final design for earned kohl's cash image" />
              </div>
              <p>Based on the flow map, the experience is designed to make sure
                that customers are aware of their savings all the time while
                scanning items. After they finish scanning, a dialoge box will
                inform customers how much Kohl’s cash they have earned.
                Lastly, the confirmation screen will once again celebrate what
                they earned in this purchase.</p>
              <div class="image-container" id="principle">
                <img src="../resources/images/sc-pilot.svg" alt="store pilot testing image" />
              </div>
              <p>This pilot testing photo shows a common scene: customers come to
                shop at Kohl’s with all the coupons collected and would like to
                make sure that she has maximized her coupons and get the rewards
                she earned.
                <br/>
                During the pilot rollout, we have:
                <br/>
                > <span class="bold">92%</span> of customers chose “Likely or Very Likely” to use again.
                <br/>
                > <span class="bold">75%</span> of customers indicated the time it took was either “Quick/Very Quick.”
