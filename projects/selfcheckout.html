        <h2>My Role &amp My Team</h2>
        <p>Creating this in-store checkout experience was very rewarding and fruitful.
        As the lead experience designer, I worked very closely with customer research,
        product manager and project planning team. Together we collaboared with a cross-
        functional team of engineer, store operations, business, loss and prevention, etc
        to ctraft this Kohl's customer tailered shopping experience from ideation to
        implementation.</p>

        <p>To understand Kohl's customers' expectations and concerns about self-check,
        when we first started this project, we sent out a national-wide survey. Together
        with a competitive analysis, we learned that two main concerns Kohl's customers
        have about self-checkout are:
        <br />
        <br />1. 72% of customers had difficult finding an associate for help.
        <br />2. 56% needed associate assistance due to difficulty with applying coupons.</p>

            <p>While checking out, theoratically, there are 3 ways for customers to sign in and
            identify themselves as a rewards member. So initially all the design concepts are
            displaying these 3 sign-in methods on a side panel of the checkout screen. However,
            out lab test results show that majority of our users are used to sign in with phone
            number and they will overlook this sign-in information, which end up with checking
            out without maximize their offers as a rewards member. To avoid this frustration,
            the redesigned flow ensured that a modal with a clear sign-in message will display
            after customers scan all their items and decide to pay.</p>

            <p>In order to push this self-checkout prior to black friday, we will have to design
              the experience without a paper receipt people usually get in their shopping experience.
              So how to design the ending part of this experience become a very instesting challenge.
              This is a seemly simple but rather complicated flow to work with. There are
              at least 8 different scenarios for the order confirmation flow. It depends on whether
              or not a purchase has: <br/><br/>
              1. earned Kohl's Cash? <br/>
              2. made by a Rewards member? <br/>
              3. security tags? <br/><br/>
            Plus, whether or not a customer would like to keep an e-receipt? To design a more
            intuitive experience, we selected some of the most complicated scenario to test with
            our customers. After rounds of design iterations and close discussions with stakeholders,
            the second last design achived an 100% success rate and a 76% overall success rate during
            usability test.</p>
